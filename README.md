## 1. Introduction

![0](/screenshots/3.jpg)

Republic and Union, as the two major opposing human forces, have been fighting for space resources for a long time. While a new kind of particle is found in a neutral galaxy, which can efficiently produce high energy or act as a optical invisible material, the two forces have sent their fleet to this area, starting a space war. Some elite ships have already been equipped with the particle to enhance their firepower and survivability. 

Choose your favorite elite battleship from three different types with their characteristic weapon and skill, follow the in-game tutorial and enjoy either the standard tricky 3v3 or the massive 8v8 intense fight.
